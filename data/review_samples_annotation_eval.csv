I think the developers deserve more love than they are getting they did an amazing job with this app, they made 3 apps in total so you can sign up for 3 accounts and have 3 different numbers and you can message for free 100% no catch as much as you want, also you start of with 10m of free calling and if you want more you can either reinstall the app and make a new account which takes a few seconds (or just have the other 2 accounts on the other 2 apps on standby) or you can watch advertisements to get voice minutes which I find great, you're supporting the developer just by using the app and to get minutes you don't automatically have to pay you can just watch and advertisement instead.

Every update makes this game more amazing. 

The normal plague types are realistic & fun, even as they annoy you. The frustration level I feel is not so much to make me want to stop playing, but enough to make the game challenging. 

The Special plague types (Neurax Worm & Zombies) are realistic with a grain of salt. Salt being zombies are not real, nor are worms that control your brain/enslave humanity. IF they were real, based on the realistic way the normal plague types play out, these are realistic too. Both cost extra (and are worth the $ IMO), so if you are the kind of person complaining that they aren't realistic, don't buy them. They take nothing away from the game, they only add a different way to play.

The music & sound effects are fantastic, but you can listen to your own music if you choose, in which case only the sound effects are audible - and the game handles this automatically without having to play around with settings.

It requires you to link your game with a Nintendo ID, which then allows you to restore purchases in a 2nd device. If you notice, there is no in-app section in the product page. This means that the restore in-app purchases are not linked to your Apple ID, instead to a Nintendo ID. This limits you to have your saves and progress to a single-user account, and you cannot play simultaneously. 

This is similar to the 3DS, all downloadable content is link to a Nintendo ID and does not allow you to download to another device, even if it has the same Nintendo ID because it also registers your device ID to avoid having more than one user playing simultaneously.

544007664,"We all know when the setup to an app or operating system changes. I hated iOS 7, and I hated Windows 8. But at least those didn't hide things. I like having apps in the same places, just looking different. 10.43 is absolutely harsh to look at. The sharp whites areas are too bright. A gray or black background would make things easier to look at. Also, finding things is difficult. I like having a sidebar with all my subs and playlists, but on the top just doesn't work. The new formatting also means banners no longer line up. I cannot be just negative, for just like the previous updates I feel like we will get used to them. But this app looks like all the other clean cut iOS 7 apps. Having something different and unique would be nice, perhaps a cool feel with less harsh brightness. 

I know that Google is trying to make everything the same and integrate their style with the Apple devices. But that is boring and difficult to understand. Be different, be unique.

447188370,"First, let me say that despite this problem, I would have given this app 5 stars after every update. The ONLY reason it has 1 star right now is so that Snapchat can try to fix this problem.

So, basically what happens is that I will be snap chatting approximately 3 people consistently throughout the day. And if I have 3 new snapchats from those people, I will open and respond to all of them, and close my phone. Sometimes, if I do that, one of the people who I snapchat will have the loading bar next to their name indefinitely, and if I log out and log back in, it will show that I only opened the snapchat and never responded. Therefore, it must be some sort of glitch. I was curious if I was causing this myself by just closing my phone right after I sent them, but I recently observed 2/3 send fine, and the other one just load and load and load. I finally had to log out to see that it appeared I never even took a snapchat in response.

544007664,"Come on YouTube. The first few reviews were being claimed what seemed like just the users who just used the app to watch amusing videos like 'cat takes a bath.' But, for a YouTuber, it's getting quite annoying with you guys changing how videos are ranked. How are we, the creators supposed to create quality content when you guys are rating us by how many likes and how long the video is. I liked the old YouTube. The old YouTube gave creators a creative mind set to create something cool but that video may not get many views because of how long the video is. Seriously, get your priorities straight, if pewdiepie (the most subscribed person on YouTube), post a good video but only gets a small amount of likes, that's mostly your fault YouTube because you guys are changing up the game and ranking videos by time and most of pewdiepie's videos are short.

The first few reviews were being claimed what seemed like just the users who just used the app to watch amusing videos like 'cat takes a bath.' But, for a YouTuber, it's getting quite annoying with you guys changing how videos are ranked. How are we, the creators supposed to create quality content when you guys are rating us by how many likes and how long the video is. I liked the old YouTube. The old YouTube gave creators a creative mind set to create something cool but that video may not get many views because of how long the video is. Seriously, get your priorities straight, if pewdiepie (the most subscribed person on YouTube), post a good video but only gets a small amount of likes, that's mostly your fault YouTube because you guys are changing up the game and ranking videos by time and most of pewdiepie's videos are short.

•Add: Chromecast support!
Regardless of the company's view of the device, Spotify users deserve to have their music on the device they want. It has been months and people are switching to Google Play Music All Access for this feature. C'mon, there's even a Spotify app for Windows Phone!

•Fix: Queue. The listener should be able to quickly change the upcoming song on the queue. This used to be much easier. See Google Play Music's Queue. 

•Fix: the edit playlist function. This used to be MUCH easier. You should be able to delete a song from a playlist w/o having to scroll all the way and tap ""edit playlist"". Perhaps add it as an option when tapping the dot next to each track. 

Things that users would enjoy:

•The ability to switch from a dark to light theme when browsing the music lists. Its seems as the app would be on a ""night mode"" like on iBooks. Perhaps automatic changing of the theme based on the device's time setting? BTW the music control view with the blur is perfect. 

•Add: uploading songs. With all this Taylor buzz, Spotify should consider letting users store their purchased music on the cloud instead of what they're doing now (having to add the local files on a playlist on the Spotify desktop app on a PC-uses no internet)",2014-12-11T18:27:00Z,False,tjosee,3.0,3.0,-2.0,3.0,Chromecast!,1111610506,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews?userProfileId=243361371,0.0,0,"Chromecast!

324684580,"Update has completely broken my radio. After updating, I went through about 4-5 songs. Some I skipped, some I rated. After last song it froze up for a bit, then started over on the last song I played before the update but partway through! Then it went in the same exact order the next 4-5 songs before dying again. Second death completely killed my Alternative Rock radio station which I had tuned to perfection with my likes and dislikes. I had to make a new one which brought in all kinds of crap I don't care for.

After a while on this new radio station it started doing the same thing. The last song I thumbs downed and it didn't skip—it just kept playing and then said something about me being offline, even through I had 4 bars of LTE. I've never had Internet problems on my way home from work. So it's a bug. Started looping back through the songs I had just played and crashed again.

So now I'm stuck listening to my playlists, which aren't too extensive. I like using the radio mode. At least I could use my favorited from radio playlist, but still. It's so hard to operate with these bugs while driving. Kind of kills the whole point of the app for me as I just set it and forget it while going to work or home.

916365675,"This keyboard has turbocharged my iPhone usage. 95% of the time it works great. That other 5% can trip you up, though I'm getting used to working around it.

Pros:
- Super fast typing with an uncanny prediction ability.
- Doesn't require ""full access"" in order to use all of its features
- Love being able to long-press keys to get numbers and symbols (e.g. hold down 'r' to get a '4'). To take advantage of this, you need to use the Dark theme - it's the only theme that displays the alternate character in the upper right corner of each key

Cons:
- They swapped the position of the 'globe' key and the '123' key. This is VERY confusing and irritating, especially when you switch between using Swype and the standard keyboard. It's screwing up my positional memory. When it comes time to hit the globe or '123', my finger always seems to head for the wrong key. 
- It removes the leading space before certain characters. If you type a space and then a hyphen, apostrophe, colon, or parenthesis, Swype will remove the space and jam the new character on the end of the previous word. 

iOS limitations (these seem to affect all 3rd-party keyboards)

- Auto-complete often doesn't work (i.e. when I start typing in an email address in the Gmail apps recipient field, I don't get a list of potentially  matching addresses).",2014-10-15T16:16:00Z,False,Jay Cagey,4.0,0.0,-3.0,3.0,"When it works, it's absolutely brilliant",1080827476,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews?userProfileId=48867946,0.0,0,"When it works, it's absolutely brilliant This keyboard has turbocharged my iPhone usage. 95% of the time it works great.

I also appreciate how I can search for an item by typing in a word. Yet another helpful feature is the notes that come up when you scan an item.

316126557,"I generally love this app. It's got turn by turn instructions for free. 

I gave it a 4 star because I think there are 2 issues with it. 

- when voice commands are played, the music I was playing really should optionally pause and resume when the voice command is done. For talk podcasts, lowering the volume to play the command makes it impossible to know what was said in the podcast. I'd have to switch over to music and replay the last 30 seconds.

Subject: Fix the Syncing Problem Already!

Since the February 16, 2015 app update, the major problem has been that it has, continually, failed to sync manually or automatically.

Uninstalling/reinstalling/rebooting/etcetera the app does NOT fix the problem; and the latest update on May 26, 2015 (v4.9.0) did NOT fix this problem either.

Many of us are long-time Kindle users, so this is unacceptable, to say the least.

After discussing this issue (among others that I have not noted here because the list is too long) with Amazon technical support, they only ever say they are working on the problems.

I will, only, update my review to a better star rating, after Amazon takes this issue seriously.
